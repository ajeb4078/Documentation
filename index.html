			<h2>Background</h2>

			<p>Food Bank Australia (FBA) is a food relief charity organisation that provides 77 million meals a year to Australians
				in need. Approximately one in five Australians have experienced food insecurity at some point in the last 12 months.
				Food insecurity is prevalent across the country and refers to when an individual doesn’t have enough food for themselves
				or their family and cannot afford to buy more food.

			<h2 id="Concept">Concept</h2>

			<p> The current Food Bank Australia site is initially overwhelming. Visually the bright purple and bold interface is overbearing
				and can be straining on the eyes of users. The main idea was to make the design more minimalistic and subtle.
			</p>

			<h3 id="profiles">Target User </h3>
			<p>For the purposes of the web prototype i have decided to mainly focus on one key user. <strong> The Donor:</strong> An individual that wishes to provide monetary support to the cause.
      </p>

			<h3 id="Mockups">Mockups I was aiming to achieve</h3>

      <h4> Landing page </h4>
			<p>The landing page was designed to mimic the new trend in minimalist sites. The interface is sleek and simple ensuring users are not overburdened like the current Food Bank Australia landing page. The Page will show on the left key text in bold whilst the right will show a simplistic graphic that encompasses the food bank brand. The landing page will have a sliding feature so that users can move to more detail without needing to click a link. This allows the user to have access to all the necessary information without being overwhelmed. Since the information is not stacked on top of each other element the down scrolling is limited this was especially necessary as a long webpage on desktop becomes longer on mobile making it difficult and annoying to use.</p>

      </figure>

     

      <h4> Donation pages </h4>

      <p>The current Food Bank Australia website had two different links for donating money and donating food. In order to simplify this process since they have the same key target user, I have decided to merge the pages into one donation page. The donation page will have a toggle switch to the top between donating money and donating food. This means that the user can switch easily between each one and limits the number of elements in the nav bar. The forms in the pages should be clear and easy for the user to input necessary information required.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>

			<h3 id="Elements">Coding intial elements</h3>
			<p>To begin the process of coding my webpage from scratch I first generated a base with most of the elements I wanted to have. This left me with basic html that had not been styled. I worked to create the form for the donation pages as well as the nav bar for the whole website.  </p>

      <figure>
      <img 
       width="709" 
       src="/process images/code basic elements.png"
       /> 
       
      </figure>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Once I had all the main html elements of my pages coded, I began styling the page. I used the colour scheme and fonts set out in my web proposal as they were clean, modern and crisp. I fiddled with laying out the items on the page in various different arrangements. Coding elements into positions proved to be difficult as it was a lot more rigid than I had anticipated. I eventually settled on a particular layout and nav bar that would be tailored for the target user a donor. The layout was picked as it wouldn’t overwhelm first time users and allow them to quickly get a glimpse into the organisation.
      </p>

      <figure>

       width="709" 
       src="/process images/laying out landing page 1.png"/>

       width="709" 
       src="/process images/laying out landing page 3.png"/> 
      </figure>
    <p>
      An important part of creating the home page was creating the button with Food Bank Australia’s logo. This proved to be an interesting element to create as it was an image as well as link. At first I used a png for the image file however this proved to be too blurry I then had to create an svg file so that it could be a scalable vector.
    </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
      Another important element of the landing page that would then be a recurring element on the whole site is the footer. I decided to keep this element quite simple so that it does not distract users from their main purpose on the site. It mainly just consists of contact details and the address of the organisation. There was a small issue with the left margin that took a bit of fiddling to resolve.

      </figure>

       <h3>About Us</h3>

       <p>
         The About us page proved to be the simplest to code. The main components of the page is text as well as an image at the bottom. I started by using the nav bar and footer from the landing page. Followed by inserting the relevant text that provide a quick summary of the charity. I then used the same illustration from my mockup that completed the aesthetic of the page.
         </p>

        <p>
          Originally the About us page was meant to be a side scroll from the landing page however this proved too difficult for me to code in the short time frame. For that reason, I decided to go with the simpler button-click to move to this page. I don’t feel like this limitation in coding execution hindered the overall user experience as a side scroll and click are both one step interactions.
        </p>

         <figure>
      <img 
       width="709" 
       src="/process images/About us page.png"/> 
      </figure>



       <h3>Donation Form</h3>
        <p>
          The next steps to completing the website was to style the donation forms. This proved to be a difficult and delicate task. In order to achieve the toggle effect, I created two buttons. I needed to style the buttons so that they appeared side by side this was important so that users could know how to interact with the webpage. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I then created to button states one that is clicked and another that is unclicked so that users can differentiate between them. The rest of the form was styled to be easy for users to use and understand. Specific inputs were grouped together like, personal details, contact details and payment details. This was good to make sure users were not confused and could understand which details were required where.  Form types also provided a design constraint where users could only input numbers in regions and inputs like dates were also made really easy.
        </p>

       width="709"

      <h3>Responsive</h3>

      <p>
      The next step to finalising the website was making it responsive to different device sizes. This proved to be the most difficult step for me personally and led me to make some difficult design choices and compromises. It is also important to note that the target user would most likely be donating from their phone thus meaning usability for phone is more important. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The first and most important thing was to make the nav bar into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. For this I used an online stylesheet library. I set 600px as the screen size I wanted the hamburger menu to appear instead of the navbar. I also had to make the nav bar elements display vertically when clicked on which also proved to be a challenge. In the end I believe I successfully implemented this element which proved to be extremely important for usability as 50% of individuals are accessing webpages through phones. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Additionally, making elements display side by side on larger screens but stack onto smaller screens proved to be difficult. I eventually was able to make the landing page display stacked however it proved to be extremely time consuming. I then used similar methods to make the other pages adaptive. When it came to the forms however I found it difficult to align them side by side and did not have time to perfect that element. Thus, I resulted to stacking the forms both on desktop and phone designs. This decision was an important compromise as users would most likely be on their phones to make donations and fill out forms. Displaying elements side by side on mobiles is not an optimum user experience.
