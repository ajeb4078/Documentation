			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Food Bank Australia (FBA) is a food relief charity organisation that provides 77 million meals a year to Australians in need. Approximately one in five Australians have experienced food insecurity at some point in the last 12 months. Food insecurity is prevalent across the country and refers to when an individual doesnâ€™t have enough food for themselves or their family and cannot afford to buy more food. 
      </p>

			</figure>

      <p>
      Food Bank Australia works with a dedicated network of farmers, manufacturers, retailers and transport services to provide fresh food to those in need. They are not only involved with combating hunger FBA are heavily in bettering the nation. This is done through various educational programs in schools as well as committing to resolve the 20 billion dollar food waste problem in Australia. 
      </p>
      <p>
      FBA relies heavily on volunteer labour to pick, pack and distribute food around the country. Despite their best efforts, many still unfortunately go hungry and FBA continues to strive to reach the objective of eliminating food insecurity in Australia.
      </p>

      

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

      <p> The current Food Bank Australia site is initially overwhelming. Visually the bright purple and bold interface is overbearing and can be straining on the eyes of users (refer to image of landing page, figure 1.2).
      </p>

      <figure>
      <img

	      <figcaption> <center> Figure 1.2: Current landing page for Food Bank Australia Website</center> </figcaption>
      </figure>

			<p> The use of the abraham-regular font (from the logo) in all caps inconsistently across various pages makes the design appear random to users. This element was designed to be playful and engaging but its random nature has a more unprofessional or childish presence (refer to image of secondary page, figure 1.3). </p>

      <figure>

	      <figcaption> Figure 1.3: Secondary page on Food Bank Australia Website </figcaption>
        </figure>

      <p>Additionally, the layout and structure of the website is highly confusing. The large amounts of unnecessary pages and links decreases overall usability (refer to condensed site map, figure 1.4). Many pages had content that was not required or already featured on another portion of the site. The repeated content made the going through the site confusing and complicated. Most pages were quite short with limited scrolling and used links to provide users with added information. This meant that a user would sometimes click through 5 different pages to reach certain parts of the site. </p>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Upon investigating the current Food Bank site, it is clear that 3 main users exist. 
      </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong> The Donor:</strong> An individual that wishes to provide monetary support to the cause.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> <strong> The Volunteer:</strong> An individual that wishes to donate time towards the cause and help distribute packages.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li> <strong>The Recipient:</strong> An individual that wishes to apply for food support and receive donations. 
      </li>
      </ol>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>In order to begin the redesign, it was important to identify which pages were most important for the Food Bank Australia site. A large portion of the current FBA site is directed towards explaining the mission of the charity and how it achieves certain objectives. However, this is not the primary users that Food bank Australia needs to cater for. It would be more effective for foodbank Australia to target donors and volunteers and simplify the processes of donation of money, food and time. The objective of the redesign is to increase use base generate a sense of community by having the application aspects front and centre of the webpage. </p>
      <p>
        The 3 main objectives of the redesign is to:
      </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Improve landing page making it more engaging.</li>
				<li>Condense the amount of pages explaining the charity mission into an indepth 'about us' page.</li>
				<li>Make the forms for donors, volunteers and recipients more accessible and usable.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>

			<p>To initiate the design process mood boards were created to gather and generate inspiration for possible designs. There were two main mood boards one with possible landing pages and another to explore possible form styles.</p>
      <h4> Landing Page </h4>
      <p>
        The landing page design inspiration showed simple sleek interfaces. The page is going to feature large and bold initial text in a sans-serif font. It will also show a key asset to the right of the screen. The colours incorporated will be the signature Food Bank Australia Purple as well as a white and black secondary colours.
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img 
       width="560" height="450"

       alt="Landing page mood board"/> 
       <figcaption> Figure 3.1: Landing page mood board </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Further exploration into landing pages showed a need to engage users beyond a sleek interface. The landing page should also be dynamic with certain assets being animated to increase visual appeal for users. 
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img 
       width="560" height="400"

       alt="Landing page inspiration from resolute motion"/> 
       <figcaption> Figure 3.3: Landing page inspiration from resolute motion </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4> Form Styles </h4>
      <p>
        A mood board was also generated to explore different form styles. Since donors, volunteers and recipients all will be required to fill in forms on the new redesigned site. The main design is simple minimalistic blocks to enter details. A progress bar increases usability as it shows what part of the form users are up to. 
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img 
       width="560" height="450"

       <figcaption> Figure 3.4: Form mood board </figcaption>
      </figure>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>

      <h4> Landing page </h4>
			<p>The landing page was designed to mimic the new trend in minimalist sites. The interface is sleek and simple ensuring users are not overburdened like the current Food Bank Australia landing page. The Page will show on the left key text in bold whilst the right will show a simplistic graphic that encompasses the food bank brand. The landing page will have a sliding feature so that users can move to more detail without needing to click a link. This allows the user to have access to all the necessary information without being overwhelmed. Since the information is not stacked on top of each other element the down scrolling is limited this was especially necessary as a long webpage on desktop becomes longer on mobile making it difficult and annoying to use.</p>
     

     <figure>
      <img

       <figcaption> Figure 4.2: Sketch of landing page (part 2)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4> Donation pages </h4>

      <p>The current Food Bank Australia website had two different links for donating money and donating food. In order to simplify this process since they have the same key target user, I have decided to merge the pages into one donation page. The donation page will have a toggle switch to the top between donating money and donating food. This means that the user can switch easily between each one and limits the number of elements in the nav bar. The forms in the pages should be clear and easy for the user to input necessary information required.</p>

      <figure>

       width="560" height="450"

       alt="Sketch of donating food  page"/> 
       <figcaption> Figure 4.4: Sketch of donating food  page </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4> Application pages </h4>

      <p>There are two main pages on the FBA website that require users to fill out an application process. This the application for becoming a volunteer and the application to receive aid from the charity. They both require a clear form so that users input accurate information in the correct sections. If the forms are too long or unclear, they could become an obstacle where individuals no longer wish to apply. Thus, the design of these pages becomes extremely important for FBA to achieve its goals of growing a community. Volunteers would require a calendar portion to help make selecting dates easier. Additionally, the recipient of aid must be ensured that answers are anonymous. The interface should also be discreet and not draw too much attention.  </p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>

			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>Wireframes were a higher fidelity version of the final sketches. The wireframes fleshed out the designs in more detail providing the basic structure of the interface.</p>

      <h4> Landing page </h4>
      <p> 
        Landing page was divided into 3 main scrolls. The first page highlights Food Bank Australia with a simple graphic. This lets users know the main purpose of the site and the organisation. It is visually simple and ensures they are not overwhelmed. The second provides more details with an about us section of the charity. The third section provides three main links for the main users. A volunteer, donate and apply for aid link are located on the 3 section of the landing page as well as the nav bar.

      <h4> Donation pages </h4>

      <p>
        The donation page has a simplistic toggle as well as a clear form for users to fill out where necessary. When doating food the users are informed about what products are accepted and what products cannot be excepted whilst filling the form to limit mistakes of donating wrong items.
        </p>

      <h4> Application pages </h4>

    <p>
      The application pages have been wireframed to provide details in one section and let users fill out the form in another section. Volunteers can have access to a calendar and checkboxes to determine which work and locations they wish to donate time towards. Additionally the recipients have checkboxes to demonstrate their circumstances for receiving aid.

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>The mockup pages have been based heavily off the pages of the wireframes. Most of which are followed to a higher fidelity. The overall aesthetic of the site is sleek minimal. It does this though having a simple font and colour scheme of two main purples used. Black, white and a light grey remain the only other colours on the site.</p>
