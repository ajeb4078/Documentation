			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Food Bank Australia (FBA) is a food relief charity organisation that provides 77 million meals a year to Australians in need. Approximately one in five Australians have experienced food insecurity at some point in the last 12 months. Food insecurity is prevalent across the country and refers to when an individual doesnâ€™t have enough food for themselves or their family and cannot afford to buy more food.

      <p>
      Food Bank Australia works with a dedicated network of farmers, manufacturers, retailers and transport services to provide fresh food to those in need. They are not only involved with combating hunger FBA are heavily in bettering the nation. This is done through various educational programs in schools as well as committing to resolve the 20 billion dollar food waste problem in Australia. 
      </p>
      <p>
      FBA relies heavily on volunteer labour to pick, pack and distribute food around the country. Despite their best efforts, many still unfortunately go hungry and FBA continues to strive to reach the objective of eliminating food insecurity in Australia.

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>

      <p> The current Food Bank Australia site is initially overwhelming. Visually the bright purple and bold interface is overbearing and can be straining on the eyes of users (refer to image of landing page, figure-1.2).
      </p>

      <figure>
      <img 
       width="560" height="300"
       src="/images/Landing page Food bank.png"
       alt="Current landing page for Food Bank Australia Website"/> 
	      <figcaption> <center> Figure 1.2: Current landing page for Food Bank Australia Website</center> </figcaption>
      </figure>

			<p> The use of the abraham-regular font (from the logo) in all caps inconsistently across various pages makes the design appear random to users. This element was designed to be playful and engaging but its random nature has a more unprofessional or childish presence (refer to image of secondary page,figure-1.3). </p>

      <figure>
			<img 
       width="560" height="300"
       src="/images/Second page food bank.png"
       alt="Secondary page on Food Bank Australia Website"/> 
	      <figcaption> Figure 1.3: Secondary page on Food Bank Australia Website </figcaption>
        </figure>

      <p>Additionally, the layout and structure of the website is highly confusing. The large amounts of unnecessary pages and links decreases overall usability (refer to condensed site map, figure-1.4). Many pages had content that was not required or already featured on another portion of the site. The repeated content made the going through the site confusing and complicated. Most pages were quite short with limited scrolling and used links to provide users with added information. This meant that a user would sometimes click through 5 different pages to reach certain parts of the site. </p>
